## What worked well with AI

**Your most successful AI interaction:**

``` text
[Describe one conversation that went really well. What made it effective? What did you learn from AI that was genuinely helpful?]
```The explanation of what a public domain poem was very effective. I learned different sites to find public domain poems that was very useful. 

**How your prompting improved:**

``` text
[Compare your first AI conversation to your last one. What did you do differently? What techniques worked best for getting useful responses?]
```I asked more detailed questions. I utilized the information given to me to ask the right question.

**AI's best contributions:**

``` text
[What was AI most helpful for? Creative ideas? Technical guidance? Something else? Give a specific example.]
```It was informative whether it was HTML/CSS guidelines. It explained it section by section why to use certain tags.

## Learning from limitations

**One thing AI got wrong or missed:**

``` text
[Specific example of incorrect info, bias, or unhelpful complexity]
```Nothing that I know of.

**Your workaround strategy:**

``` No workaround needed
[How you dealt with this limitation]
```N/A

**Advice for other students:**

``` text
[One specific tip based on what you learned]
```Ask a question you need an answer to then follow up by using the same information provided to ask remaining questions it will help give you more detailed answers.

## Ready for implementation?

**Are you prepared to start coding your poetry website?** [Yes/No]

**Why or why not?**

``` Yes and no. I feel I have the bases for what I need but I'm still conflicted about starting.

[Explain your confidence level. What aspects of the plan feel solid? What might still need work?]
```Confidence is a 5 out of 10. The brainstorming feels solid cause I know where everything has to go. Until I get it how I want everything needs work.

**How will you use AI in the main Poetry project?**

``` text
[Based on this experience, how will you approach AI collaboration when you start building your actual website? What will you do the same or differently?]
```I will use it to help me understand what I'm doing wrong and the steps I can take to fix it without fully relying on AI to write the code for me.

**Most important lesson learned:**

``` text
[What's the single most valuable thing you learned about working with AI that you'll carry forward to future projects?]
```I learned that AI is not always accurate and t double check your work before submitting it. 

**Public domain verification:**

``` text
[Confirm your final poem choice is actually public domain. If you discovered it wasn't during your research, explain how you found a replacement.]
```I verified that it was public domain by the publication date. Anything before 1929 are in the public domain and since it was published in 1818 and the author died over 100 years ago.
